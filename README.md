A colorpicker for React
---

[![npm version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/@mapbox/react-colorpickr.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/@mapbox/react-colorpickr) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/mapbox/react-colorpickr.svg?token=YkkMPyN1R9p9yTUwpzb5&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/mapbox/react-colorpickr)

__[Demo](https://labs.mapbox.com/react-colorpickr/)__

## Install

    npm install @mapbox/react-colorpickr

You'll also want to include a copy of [colorpickr.css](https://github.com/mapbox/react-colorpickr/blob/mb-pages/dist/colorpickr.css) in your code.

``` html
<link href='react-colorpickr.css' rel='stylesheet' />
```

## Usage

```js
import React from 'react'
import ColorPicker from '@mapbox/react-colorpickr'

export default class Example extends React.PureComponent {
  onChange = color => {
    console.log(color);
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <ColorPicker onChange={this.onChange} />
    )
  }
}
```

## Required properties

#### `onChange`

Value should be a function and is called whenever a color is updated from
the colorpicker. Returns a color object.

## Optional properties

#### `theme`

By default, react-colorpickr depends on [Assembly](https://labs.mapbox.com/assembly/) and the CSS located in [`dist/colorpickr.css`](https://github.com/mapbox/react-colorpickr/blob/mb-pages/dist/colorpickr.css). You can however, override it thanks to [react-themeable](https://github.com/markdalgleish/react-themeable) which react-colorpickr uses internally. See the properties used and the class name values in [`theme.js`](https://github.com/mapbox/react-colorpickr/blob/mb-pages/src/theme.js).

#### `initialValue`

Accepts any [valid css color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value). If this isn't provided, a default color is used.

#### `mode`

Defaults to `hsl`. Initializes which color model tab is active.
Possible options: `hsl`, `rgb`.

#### `channel`

Defaults to `h`. Initializes which color channel is active.
Possible options: `h`, `s`, `l`, `r`, `g`, `b`.

#### `reset`

If `reset` is provided as a property with a value of `true` a reset button is
added that when pressed, reverts back to the original color when the
colorpicker is initialized on the page. Defaults to `true`.

#### `mounted`

To use internal methods from react-colorpickr, `mounted` provides access to the components instance. This is helpful for calling methods like `overrideValue` that can manually set a new color.

```js
instance = null;

setInstance = picker => {
  this.instance = picker;
};

override = () => {
  this.instance.overrideValue('red');
};

render() {
  <div>
    <ColorPickr mounted={this.setInstance} onChange={console.log} />
    <button onClick={this.override}>Override</button>
  </div>
}
```

#### `readOnly`

If `readOnly` is provided with a value of `true`, the colorpicker will render in a readonly state with values clearly shown and selectable, but not editable.
